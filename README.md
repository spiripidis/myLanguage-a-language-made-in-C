Lalanguage is an imperative, general-purpose programming language with object-oriented and functional traits that is specifically designed to help new users get familiar with programming. It is a simple language that follows the basic rules of major programming languages such as C, C++, JAVA, and C#.

Lalanguage was created for educational purposes using Visual Code as an IDE, Flex for the lexical analyzer, and Bison for the syntactical analyzer. The syntax of Lalanguage is simple, making it easy for users to understand and learn.

To write a program in Lalanguage, you start with a Class followed by an identifier or name for the class enclosed in brackets. This is followed by the main function, which has a type integer, parenthesis, and brackets to continue, along with some global declarations outside of the main function.

In Lalanguage, variables can be of type character, string, float, integer, void, and Boolean, and assignment is done by declaring the type, the identifier, the assignment (=) mark, and the value of the respective type. The language can handle expressions and relational operations where needed, and mathematical operations can also be performed.

Custom functions can be written and declared in Lalanguage. However, it is essential to put a semicolon at the end of the line where you declare the function after the closing parenthesis for correct function use later in the program. Control flow functions such as if and else are present, and you can proceed with opening brackets and writing functions, expressions, or assignments as needed for your program.

The operators that the language can use include: <, >, <=, >=, +, -, /, *, ;, !=, %, ==, =. Identifiers are recognized by the language as tokens, strings. However, Lalanguage does not have any pointers or references.

Lalanguage is a language that does not specialize in anything particular but is great for writing "Hello World" programs and trying simple algorithms to get accustomed to the process of programming. It was developed to help people get familiar with programming and to provide a stepping stone towards learning more advanced programming languages.

Thank you for choosing Lalanguage! We hope you enjoy using this language and that it helps you on your journey to becoming a proficient programmer.
